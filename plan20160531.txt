1. Moving Ship with a turning button
2. Square Map with simple boundary, and boundary logic for moving ship
3. Adding bullets to the ship, and adding free floating grey asteroids of
different shapes
to the simple map
4. Adding another ship with the same abilities as the first ship. Adding
shooting
logic, and kill logic. Both of these ships compete in the square map. Ships will
not disintegrate into pilots at this point. They will, however, die. (this is
the ”Head Hunters” mode
5. ”Pilot Execution”: this includes movement of pilots, kill logic for pilots,
and regen- eration. This will be a crucial step in the roadmap
6. We will then add some power-ups such as lasers, bombs, lancers, and reverse
alls. This is all still happening in our simple square boundary map.
7. Then we will add orange asteroids to hold power-ups, which would be able to
be picked up.
8. We will then start to add map objects such as breakable walls, open walls,
beams, etc.
9. We will then create separate maps.
10. We will then add up to 4 players in the game. We will figure out the bugs,
nuances,
and other problems that arise in the game at that point.
11. We will continue to include more elaborate features, if we have time, such
as: anti-
gravity wells, turrets, auto-balancing, better graphics, better user-interfaces.
We will fix any and all bugs that come up, and continue to develop some other
cool feature when they come to mind.
